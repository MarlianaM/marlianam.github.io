Iâ€™m a Junior at Virginia Tech, majoring in Computer Engineering with a focus on controls, robotics, and autonomy. Passionate about innovation and problem-solving, I thrive on applying technology in creative ways to drive meaningful change. My interests lie at the intersection of engineering and entrepreneurship, and I aspire to pursue a career in international field service within application engineering. Whether tackling complex challenges or developing solutions that push the boundaries of technology, I am always looking for opportunities to innovate and make an impact.
